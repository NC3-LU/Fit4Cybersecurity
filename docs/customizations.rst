Templates customization per site
--------------------------------

It is possible to customize specific templates for each available site.
This can be done by creating a folder with the `site_name` config parameter value
and place it under the same directory as it is located under the original templates.
The new template will be loaded automatically if exists,can inherit the parent template
and only override its specific blocks.
