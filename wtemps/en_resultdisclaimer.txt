DISCLAIMER: The software, materials and assistance provided by Cases.lu have the only purpose of helping users with compliance regarding their data protection requirements. In particular, the recommendations Cases.lu provides are generated automatically, yet every word of our survey and recommendation has been written and continuously revised by our team. However, as it can be easily understood, nothing can substitute a professional consultancy in the drafting of your policies, or of any other document or data protection procedure. Our service does its best to provide you with a starting point, but even if we strive to provide the best assistance possible, we cannot guarantee any conformity with the legal requirements, which only a legal or information security professional can do. Nothing on this site, therefore, shall be considered as a data protection legal advice and no client relationship is established. Please note that in some cases, depending on your national legislation, further actions may be required to make your activity compliant with existing regulations and data protection requirements.

This survey has been created to help users assess their compliance with the main requirements for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It does not constitute an exhaustive list of all requirements requested by the European and national data protection legal framework, nor does it constitute a legal analysis.
