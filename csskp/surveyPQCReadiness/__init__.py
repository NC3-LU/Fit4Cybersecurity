        "Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) readiness refers to the practice of "
        "preparing computer systems, networks, and sensitive information "
        "for protection against future threats posed by quantum computing."
        "Advances in quantum technologies are expected to break widely"
        "used cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and ECC,"
        "creating potential vulnerabilities across digital infrastructures."
        "This makes PQC readiness essential for businesses of all sizes,"
        "since even small organizations could face risks with serious financial,"
        "reputational, and regulatory consequences."
        "<strong> By proactively planning the transition"
        "to quantum-safe cryptographic solutions,"
        "SMEs can safeguard their digital assets, ensure long-term resilience, "

        "This questionnaire is intended for <strong> all businesses,"

        " this questionnaire is anonymous </strong> — but to evaluate the overall "
        " ecosystem’s readiness and awareness regarding the importance of initiating early considerations for PQC."
