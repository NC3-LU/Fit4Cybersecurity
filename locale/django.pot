"This questionnaire, created in consultation with <a href=\"https://cnpd.public.lu/en.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNPD</a>, "
"aims to help organisations assess to what extent they are "
"in control of their personal data risks. First, Fit4Privacy asks questions "
"to understand the amount of personal data processing already in place, then "
"its questions examine the response of the organisation towards GDPR "
"obligations. Based on the identified scope, the tool offers a set of "
"recommendations that could be consolidated into the first steps towards "
"implementing privacy and data protection. Note that this is a self-"
"assessment tool and as such cannot provide definitive guidelines. Yet, "
"Fit4Privacy is raising awareness around key topics such as personal data "
"processing, data lifecycle management, and basic data protection obligations "
"for which organisations should already be prepared as of 2021."
