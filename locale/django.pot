"The objective of the self-assessment tool,\n"
"            %(tool_name)s is to assess the maturity of an organization in "
"terms of\n"
"            applicable good practices in the field of information security.\n"
"            <br /><br />\n"
"            This document, based on the %(tool_name)s, is for the exclusive "
"use of\n"
"            the customer. It is in this respect confidential.\n"
"            <br /><br />\n"
"            In view of the methodology used and the fact that it is a self-"
"assessment,\n"
"            it is understood that the overall results can not in any way be "
"exhaustive.\n"
"            As such, the actual risk assessment or the list of identified "
"risks and\n"
"            vulnerabilities are based on the information provided by the "
"client.\n"
"            The analysis resulting from this assessment can engage only the "
"customer\n"
"            for any omission or error that would be due to third parties or "
"not.\n"
"            <br /><br />\n"
"            The tool, %(tool_name)s can possibly provide recommendations. It "
"is\n"
"            understood by the client that the recommendations are neither "
"exclusive\n"
"            nor exhaustive.\n"
"            <br /><br />\n"
"            It should also be noted that the information you have provided "
"to us will\n"
"            be recorded for statistical reasons.\n"
"            Due to the nature of the data, we can not identify you. Unless "
"you later\n"
"            contact us to do a Diagnostic CASES."
