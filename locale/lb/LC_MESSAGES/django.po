"This survey will ask a few questions and provide recommendations. Keep in "

"This questionnaire aims to identify the general scope of the contractual "
"relationship considered, in order to set up an acquisition, a lease, a "
"development or any other service in the field of information and "
"communication technologies. Based on this scope, Fit4Contract provides a "
"list of basic information security requirements that are recommended to be "
"considered in establishing the contractual relationship. This is a self "
"assessment tool and as such cannot provide definitive guidelines. This tool "
"is simply raising awareness for Information Security in ICT product and "
"service contracts. Additionally, many countries have their own legal "
"requirements for contracts and thus, we do not take any responsibilities "
"concerning the answers and we clarify that the user of this survey needs to "
"verify, and adapt their contracts accordingly, to comply with all national "
"and international laws."

"The objective of the self-assessment tool, is to measure the maturity of an "
"organization in terms of applicable good practices in the field of "
"information security.<br /> This document, as the outcome of the self-"
"assessment, is for the exclusive use of the user. It is in this respect "
"confidential.<br /> Given the methodology used and the fact that it is a "
"self-assessment, the overall results cannot be exhaustive in any way.<br /> "
"As such, the actual risk assessment or the list of identified risks and "
"vulnerabilities is therefore based on the information provided by the user."
"<br /> The tool may provide recommendations, but the user must be aware that "
"these are neither exclusive nor exhaustive.<br /> It should also be noted "
"that the information you have provided to us is recorded for statistical "
"reasons.<br /> Due to the nature of the data, we cannot identify you, the "
"self-assessment is performed anonymously."

"This survey aims to identify the level of maturity of the operators in "
"Luxembourg with respect to risk management and governance, collaboration on "
"national and EU level and Incident reporting. We collect the answers to "
"these 30 questions to understand where guidance and knowledge is already "
"advanced and where there is room for improvement. As such, it is recommended "
"that a person is taking this survey that is knowing the company's maturity "
"on the aforementioned topics well. <br /><br />The survey will be online and "
"available between December 2021 and April 30th 2022. After the survey, the "
"data will be processed and results will be interpreted. However, since the "
"survey is completely anonymous, we cannot identify you nor your company and "
"thus deletion of specific records is not possible: we cannot be sure that it "
"is indeed your survey. The results will be made available through another "
"channel.<br /><br />If you are not able to do the survey in one go and you "
"want to later pick up where you have left off, please be sure to save the "
"link by clicking on the \"continue later\" button. We will not be able to "
"help you to find your answers again otherwise."

"This questionnaire, created in consultation with <a href=\"https://cnpd."
"public.lu/en.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNPD</a>, aims to help organisations "
"assess to what extent they are in control of their personal data risks. "
"First, Fit4Privacy asks questions to understand the amount of personal data "
"processing already in place, then its questions examine the response of the "
"organisation towards GDPR obligations. Based on the identified scope, the "
"tool offers a set of recommendations that could be consolidated into the "
"first steps towards implementing privacy and data protection. Note that this "
"is a self-assessment tool and as such cannot provide definitive guidelines. "
"Yet, Fit4Privacy is raising awareness around key topics such as personal "
"data processing, data lifecycle management, and basic data protection "
"obligations for which organisations should already be prepared as of 2021."

"A RESTful Web Services work with HTTP URL Paths, hence it is crucial to "
"apply the same level of security like a website. Below recommendations "
"should be observed when designing a RESTful Web Service:\n"
"\n"
"- Input Validation: Verify and validate all inputs on the server.\n"
"- Session Based Authentication: Authenticate every user making request to a "
"Web Service method.\n"
"- No Sensitive data in the URL: Username, password or session token should "
"never be indicated in a URL, but communicated to Web Service via the POST "
"method.\n"
"- Restriction on Method Execution: Allow restricted use of GET, POST and "
"DELETE methods.\n"
"- Validate Malformed XML/JSON: Check for well-formed input passed to a web "
"service method.\n"
"- Throw generic Error Messages: Error messages should not disclose any "
"system or root cause information to the user, but rather generic HTTP error "
"messages like 403 to show access forbidden, 500 to indicate internal server "
"error, etc."
