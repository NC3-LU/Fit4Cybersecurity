This self-assessment tool is named {{ tool_name }} to highlight the introduction to information security.
It is also a prerequisite for doing a CASES Diagnostic: a minimum score of {{ minimal_acceptable_score }}/100 is required.
The purpose for this restriction gives us the opportunity to better tailor the recommendations to your organization during the Diagnostic.
<br><br>
During this self-assessment multiple choice questions were asked. After analyzing your answers, recommendations have been provided.
<br><br>
Finally, you can download a report, which will help you to communicate the results to your suppliers, if necessary.
