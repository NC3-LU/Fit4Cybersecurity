This self-assessment tool is named {{ custom.tool_name }} to highlight the introduction to information security. It is also a prerequisite for doing a CASES Diagnostic: a minimum score of {{ custom.minimal_acceptable_score }}/100 is required. The purpose for this restriction gives us the opportunity to better tailor the recommendations to your organization during the Diagnostic.<br /><br />
During this self-assessment multiple choice questions were asked. After analyzing your answers, recommendations have been provided.<br /><br />
Finally, you can download a report, which will help you to communicate the results to your suppliers, if necessary.
