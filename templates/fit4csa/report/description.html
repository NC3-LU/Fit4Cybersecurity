This self-assessment tool is named Fit4CSA to highlight the basic requirements defined in the EU Cybersecurity Act. The self-assessment is the first step in the basic-level certification process defined in the CORAL project.
<br><br>
A minimum score of 85% is required to be able to initiate the certification process with an external auditor. The auditor will further review your controls and request potential evidence based on his/her judgments.
<br><br>
During this self-assessment, multiple-choice questions were asked. After analyzing your answers, recommendations have been provided. Finally, you can download a report, which would be the basic documentation of a CSA-basic level certification
