            <h2><a id="enforcement">Enforcement</a></h2>
            <p>CASES may investigate and prosecute violations of these terms to the fullest legal extent. CASES may notify and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting violations of the law and these terms.</p>
            <p>CASES reserves the right to change, redact, and delete content on the website for any reason. If you believe someone has submitted content to the website in violation of these terms, <a href="#contact">please contact us immediately</a>.</p>
            <h2><a id="your-content">Your Content</a></h2>
            <p>Nothing in these terms gives CASES any ownership rights in intellectual property that you share with the website. Nothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in CASES's intellectual property, either.</p>
            <p>It should also be noted that the information you have provided will be recorded for <b>statistical reasons</b>, but because of the nature of the data processed and stored, we cannot identify you. Unless you contact us.</p>
            <p>Between you and CASES, you remain solely responsible for content you submit to the website. You agree not to wrongly imply that content you submit to the website is sponsored or approved by CASES. These terms do not obligate CASES to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit.</p>
            <p>Content you submit to the website belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others for it. But at a minimum, you license CASES to provide content that you submit to the website to other users of the website. That special license allows CASES to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the website.</p>
            <p>When content you submit is removed from the website, whether by you or by CASES, CASES's special license ends when the last copy disappears from CASES's backups, caches, and other systems. Other licenses you apply to content you submit may continue after your content is removed. Those licenses may give others, or CASES itself, the right to share your content through the website again.</p>
            <p>Others who receive content you submit to the website may violate the terms on which you license your content. You agree that CASES will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.</p>
            <h2><a id="responsibility">Your Responsibility</a></h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify CASES from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your data on the website. Both you and CASES agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify CASES as soon as possible. If CASES fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won't have to indemnify CASES for damages that you could have defended against or mitigated with prompt notice. You agree to allow CASES to control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify CASES, and to cooperate with those efforts. CASES agrees to not accept any settlement that admits fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.</p>
            <h2><a id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</a></h2>
            <p><em><strong>You accept all risk of using the website and content on the website. As far as the law allows, CASES provides the website as is, without any warranty whatsoever.</strong></em></p>
            <p>The website may hyperlink to and integrate websites and services run by others. CASES does not make any warranty about services run by others, or content they may provide. Use of services run by others may be governed by other terms between you and the one running service.</p>
            <h2><a id="liability">Limits on Liability</a></h2>
            <p>Taking into account that this methodology is relying on your self-evaluation, you must understand that the overall results can not in any way be exhaustive. Thus, the actual risk assessment or list of identified risks and vulnerabilities is based on information provided by the Customer. The analysis resulting from this assessment can engage only the customer for any omission or error that would be due to third parties or not.</p>
            <p><em><strong>CASES will not be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages company personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>As far as the law allows, CASES's total liability to you for claims of any kind that are related to the website or content on the website will be limited to $50.</strong></em></p>
            <h2><a id="feedback">Feedback</a></h2>
            <p>CASES welcomes your feedback and suggestions for the website. See the <a href="#contact">Contact</a> section below for ways to get in touch with us.</p>
            <p>You agree that CASES will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide, and that CASES won't have to notify you that your feedback was used, get your permission to use it, or pay you. You agree not to submit feedback or suggestions that you believe might be confidential or proprietary, to you or others.</p>
            <h2><a id="termination">Termination</a></h2>
            <p>Either you or CASES may end the agreement written out in these terms at any time. When our agreement ends, your permission to use the website also ends.</p>
            <p>The following provisions survive the end of our agreement: <a href="#your-content">Your Content</a>, <a href="#feedback">Feedback</a>, <a href="#responsibility">Your Responsibility</a>, <a href="#disclaimers">Disclaimers</a>, <a href="#limits-on-liability">Limits on Liability</a>, and <a href="#general">General Terms</a>.</p>
            <h2><a id="disputes">Disputes</a></h2>
            <p>Luxembourg law will govern any dispute, including any legal proceedings, related to these terms or your use of the website.</p>
            <p>Any arbitration award will include costs of the arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees, and reasonable costs for witnesses. You or CASES may enter arbitration awards in any court with jurisdiction.</p>
            <h2><a id="general">General Terms</a></h2>
            <p>If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. Otherwise, that provision should be removed.</p>
            <p>You may not assign your agreement with CASES. CASES may assign your agreement to any affiliate of CASES, any other company that obtains control of CASES, or any other company that buys assets of CASES related to the website. Any attempted assignment against these terms has no legal effect.</p>
            <p>Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.</p>
            <p>These terms embody all the terms of agreement between you and CASES about use of the website. These terms entirely replace any other agreements about your use of the website, written or not.</p>
            <h2><a id="contact">Contact</a></h2>
            <p>You may notify CASES under these terms, and send questions to CASES, at <a href="mailto:info@cases.lu">info@cases.lu</a>.</p>
            <p>CASES is part of Securityamdein.lu g.i.e., 16, bd d’Avranches L-1160 Luxembourg Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg</p>
            <h2><a id="changes">Changes</a></h2>
            <p>CASES last updated these terms on October 27, 2020, and may update these terms again. CASES will post all updates to the website. For updates that contain substantial changes, CASES agrees to e-mail you, if you have provided a valid e-mail address. CASES may also announce updates with special messages or alerts on the website.</p>
            <p>Once you get notice of an update to these terms, you must agree to the new terms in order to keep using the website.</p>
