The objective of the self-assessment tool, is to measure the maturity of an organization in terms of applicable good practices in the field of information security.<br />
This document, as the outcome of the self-assessment, is for the exclusive use of the user. It is in this respect confidential.<br />
Given the methodology used and the fact that it is a self-assessment, the overall results cannot be exhaustive in any way.<br />
As such, the actual risk assessment or the list of identified risks and vulnerabilities is therefore based on the information provided by the user.<br /><br />
The tool may provide recommendations, but the user must be aware that these are neither exclusive nor exhaustive.<br />
It should also be noted that the information you have provided to us is recorded for statistical reasons.<br />
Due to the nature of the data, we cannot identify you, the self-assessment is performed anonymously.
