This self-assessment tool is intended to record the current state of the information security within your organisation.
It is also a prerequisite for performing further diagnostics: a minimum score of {{ minimal_acceptable_score }}/100 s required for this.
The purpose of this restriction gives us the opportunity to better tailor recommendations to your organisation during further diagnostics.
As the data has been collected anonymously, you will need to contact us explicitly for further diagnostics and provide us this report.<br /><br />
During this self-assessment multiple choice questions will be asked and afterwards recommendations will be provided.<br />
Finally, you can download a report to help you to analyse the results and share it with your IT service provider, if necessary.
